The system ignite the flame fine I even put my manometer in series with the inducer port I was getting 0.65 It's a two-stage furnace One pressure switch is rated 0.25 and the other 0.30. I put my amp meter on the inducer motor I was getting 1.1 amps It's rated for 1.4 amps One thing I did notice though whenever it switched over to second stage the inducer motor never increased its amp draw which it should have. The gas valve is now in second stage but it seems like the inducer motor is stuck in first stage I did check the port that's plugged into the board when I checked common to first stage I was getting 120 volts but when I checked common to second stage I was getting some weird voltage I was getting 210 volts which I thought was weird it was pretty late at this point I just went ahead and called it and said I was going to go ahead and order the inducer motor and the control board but just for future reference do you guys believe it was the inducer motor or the control board that was the issue The furnace kept running when I was there eventually it would kick itself out I believe it's because of the gas valve is feeding too much and the inducer didn't switch over to the second stage which is overfeeding too much gas causing the pressure switch drop out anybody else run into this issue before?\n\nRheem \nModel number - RGPE-07EAMKR",

Gauges don't move when this happens.  Daikin suggested rotation of the tap point by 30 degrees.  We've also replaced the flow switch thinking it might be bad.  Running out of ideas here.

First instinct tells me it may be a heat exchanger literally only because I heard it somewhere. I put a grill lighter down the burners(I was told when I asked for an analyzer months ago that ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have one and you don‚Äôt need it‚Äù) and sure enough, it‚Äôs blowing straight back at me with the fan on. It is a 2018 unit, still under warranty so I figure we‚Äôre good because she‚Äôs covered. I disable the unit and bring everything my boss needs to get replacements. Then comes the interrogation, which is understandable to an extent. He proceeds to tell me it can‚Äôt be the heat exchanger because it‚Äôs not rolling out (it‚Äôs LP). The argument boiled down to ‚ÄúNuh uh‚Äù. \nNOW here is the real issue. I overheard him talking with another ‚Äúveteran of the field‚Äù and his exact words were ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll just take the combustion analyzer, tell her we checked it, and tell her Veto made a mistake.‚Äù Potentially poisoning this person for what? To save some money on a warranty she was sold? To not admit having learned something from a younger person? Mind you, he DOES NOT KNOW HOW to use a combustion analyzer. And he didn‚Äôt even know about the ‚Äúmatch test‚Äù for the burner tubes. Am I insane? I‚Äôve been wrong on other things, I have no issues with being wrong, but to not even check and just lie is disgusting to me. What would you do here? \n\nUPDATE: I told the customer everything this morning, and suggested she seek out another company for a 2nd opinion. Thank you all for reminding me there are still people that give a shit.",

Board was giving me a pressure switch code and acting like the pressure switches never closed. So first I removed the flue from inducer, and board is still giving me code. Inducer is pulling perfect amperage and pushing air. Then I cleared all orifices on pressure switch and inducer and collector box, and same thing. Then I removed drain trap and checked all external drains and all is good, no water is being retained in the system while running heat. Then I decided to pull the wires off the pressures switches and checked resistance while the inducer is running and sure enough the pressure switch is closed the whole time, all the way until the system locks out. I checked all of the pressure switch wires from the board to the pressure switches and nothing is damaged or open. I even unplugged the molex plug that the pressure switches are wired into, blew it like a Nintendo cartridge and plugged it back in. Still same thing. My instinct sais Bad board. I‚Äôve replaced 5-6 bad board in my career and I‚Äôve never been wrong. Mostly it‚Äôs been things like, not energizing gas valve, not energizing blower with 120 when I have 24v to G, board not giving 120v to primary of transformer. Things like that. But this one stumped me because of it being a pressure switch code. But the entire time the system was running the pressure switch was closed and all wiring is intact. The customer was an electrical engineer and said he‚Äôs going to order a new board on Amazon, so I guess I‚Äôll never know if I was wrong. What do u guys think",

Before filling it back up, they wanted me to check the unit and make sure it worked. \nI bypassed the differential pressure switch to get it to turn on and was getting crazy high discharge pressures (600+ psig)\nI told them the unit worked, but would need to be filled to get proper readings. I figured the drum was really hot compared to normal with just air in there. They filled it and it was still reading very high suction (80) and discharge (600). Normal operating pressures are 24/275. \nChecked the txv sensing bulb, it was functioning properly. No split across the drier. Restriction likely not the issue as suction and discharge were high. Pressures with it off we're almost 300. Figured maybe it was way overcharged. \nPulled 2.2 lbs out, which is exactly what it is supposed to have. Blew it out with nitro, pulled vacuum, and charged with virgin refrigerant. Pressures were right on.\nI have no idea why this thing was reading so high. Anybody have any insight?\n\nTldr - suction and discharge refrigerant pressures were very high for no reason as far as I can tell. Recovered, vacuumed, and charged fresh and they normalized.",

As the manager is giving me roof hatch access she states that I see what the gas smell is coming from while I'm up on the roof. \n    Now I'm used to the insane customers that are constantly smelling gas (Even if they have electric heat pump units lol) yada yada yada everyone always smells gas. But not this time this was a real concern. As I entered the roof, natural gas smell hit me in the face (very glad I wasn't smoking walking up to the unit) I find the dog grooming unit, inducer motor is steady on, and the smell of gas is unbearable. I get the cover off and I have 24 volts energizing my gas valve with no flame. The board is showing a 59 code on this lennox rtu which says gas valve one not energized 2 minutes after demand N times. N is defined by ecto 3.04. \n\n    I shut the unit down immediately to let the gas clear from the area. Turn the unit back on, notice that the spark ignition wire is laying in the unit not connected. \n\nLooks like somebody has recently changed his heat exchanger. A lot of the wires and plugs inside the unit are burnt and repaired with crimped butt sleeves. Looks like flame was rolling out of holes on panel that divides heat exchanger and electrical compartment.  \n after powering the unit back on, no flame (on purpose) I wanted to see how long it would take for the gas valve to de-energize. Which it does not. After multiple attempts it should lock itself out but it does not. 24 volts remains at the gas valve, so I am going through the diagram to see what's what. Make sure everything got wired up correctly. \n\nSorry for the long rant, but has this ever happened to anybody before? I've never seen an ignition control module fail in this way?",

    "x_post": "Sizing on new installs\n\nIt's long, but please read if you have time because i need some advice.\n\nRecently i had a negative experience with a customer. Went to a house for a no heat call, early 2000s 70k btu A cabinet 90+ in a 1300ish sqft house, flames shooting out, tried to adjust things but it was clear it was a replacement scenario. The supply plenum was just a 14x20x36 box with 3 six inch runs coming off it. Only 3 thats it. Return was better, filter boot with 8x20 going up and to multiple large floor grilles.\n\nAnyways, I quote the customer a new 60k 90+ while explaining several times about the undersized ductwork. It is a low income area, house is a mess, customer only has the money for the swap out and nothing more. I tried my best to explain why i wasn't going to put a 40k in because of the size and the needs of the house, and that the 60k may not run and we may need to open some of the plenum after install to have heat in the house. Customer says they understand and agree.\n\nFast forward to turn on, yes it immediately trips so I cut out an 8x20 hole on the back of the plenum, put a temporary 8x20 grille over it, and give them a VERY cheap quote to add an plenum 8x20 plenum through a specific route, with 7-8 runs off it throughout the house. Maybe someday they say. Ok fine.\n\nAfter a few days they complain about the terrible temperature imbalance between different areas of the house so I give them a few options good better best and they said they have no money and also magically have no recollection of our conversation about their undersized ductwork and everything and said the old furnace worked way better than the new one. I feel this is turning into a possible bad reputation deal for me, so I go over there, donate a few hours and two 10\" flex ducts and give them quite a bit more distribution and balance than they had before. Very far from ideal, but the issue is more or less solved and they didn't have to pay anything for the additional work, so they are a satisfied customer now.\n\nGetting to the point, I have two questions:\n\n1. When ductwork is clearly undersized, why do old furnaces work for so long and new furnaces do not, which components are different? The old furnace had a high limit, it had rollouts, what is the deal?\n\n2. It's always a stressful thing for me to size a new unit for a customer and have to decide between the size of the house and the capacity of the ductwork while trying to keep my price competitive and not trying to scare the customer to potential extra ductwork costs that i know some other guys aren't going to bother with. Do you guys have any advice for preventing conflict and misunderstanding? It is a lot to explain every time im in this scenario, and i know the more i talk the less they absorb.\n\n\n\nLast thing, i have another job I'm bidding on now with a 120k 90+ and only an 8x24 duct as the supply plenum. It has been working for years like that, and the other guys are just quoting a swap, but i know it could use more than just a swap. So this is yet another similar situation for me. Any advice is appreciated.\n\nThanks",
